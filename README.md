- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Greg Schreiter
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects for medical data science and general machine learning. In 2025, I'm hoping to reproduce some results from classic ML papers, so stay tuned!
- ðŸŒ± The languages I often use are Python, SQL, and ISLR-level R. I prefer Python to R because there isn't as much bloat. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: schreitergregory@gmail.com
- :point_down: The top 4 pinned projects are from the Data Visualization and Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota (2024). You may also find the repo for my in-progress work on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow."
