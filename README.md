- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Greg Schreiter
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects for medical data science and general machine learning. In 2025, I'm hoping to reproduce some results from classic ML papers, so stay tuned!
- ðŸŒ± I'm most familiar with Python but I also use SQL (postgres), R and Matlab regularly. Currently learning Julia and Java.

- :point_down: The top 4 pinned projects are from the Data Visualization and Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota (2024). You may also find the repo for the code notebooks of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" as well as my master's practicum for Medxoom of Atlanta.
